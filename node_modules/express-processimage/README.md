Middleware that processes images according to the query
string. Intended to be used in a development setting with the
`connect.static` middleware, but should work with any middleware
further down the stack, even an http proxy.

**Important note: This module is intended for development. You're
strongly discouraged from using it in production or with any kind of
untrusted input. Parts of the query string will be passed directly to
various command line tools.**

The response will be be processed under these circumstances:

* If the request has a query string and accepts `image/*`.
* If the response is served with a `Content-Type` of `image/*`.

`express-processimage` plays nice with conditional GET. If the
original response has an ETag, `express-processimage` will add to it
so the ETag of the processed image never clashes with the original
ETag. That prevents the middleware issuing the original response from
being confused into sending a false positive `304 Not Modified` if
`express-processimage` is turned off or removed from the stack later.


Query string syntax
-------------------

`express-processimage` supports `pngcrush`, `pngquant`, `optipng`,
`jpegtran`, <a
href="https://github.com/papandreou/node-inkscape">`inkscape`</a>, <a
href="https://github.com/papandreou/node-svgfilter">`svgfilter`</a>,
and all methods listed under "manipulation" and "drawing primitives"
in the <a href="https://github.com/aheckmann/gm#methods">documentation
for the gm module</a>.

Multiple tools can be applied to the same image (separated by `&`, and
the order is significant). Arguments for the individual tools are
separated by non-URL encoded comma or plus.

```
http://localhost:1337/myImage.png?pngcrush=-rem,alla
http://localhost:1337/myImage.png?pngcrush=-rem+alla
http://localhost:1337/myImage.png?optipng=-o7
http://localhost:1337/bigImage.png?resize=400,300&pngquant=128&pngcrush
http://localhost:1337/hello.png?setFormat=gif
http://localhost:1337/logo.svg?inkscape
http://localhost:1337/file.svg?svgfilter=--runScript=makeItBlue.js
```

Installation
------------

Make sure you have node.js and npm installed, then run:

    npm install express-processimage

Example usage
-------------

Express 3.0 syntax:

```javascript
var express = require('express'),
    processImage = require('express-processimage'),
    root = '/path/to/my/static/files';

express()
    .use(processImage({root: root}))
    .use(express.static(root))
    .listen(1337);
```

The `root` option is used by <a
href="https://github.com/papandreou/node-svgfilter">node-svgfilter</a>
for finding the location of external JavaScript files to run on the SVG document.

Development with Docker
-----------------------

Build the docker image by running:

```
$ npm run docker:build
```

Open the development environment:

```
$ npm run docker
```

The above command will place you in a bash shell where the working directory is
your express-processimage checkout from your local machine. It is mounted into
the container which is based on Ubuntu 14.04 and contains all the required
dependencies, and nvm with the latest node 8 version active.

If you need to run the tests against another node version, you just have to
change the version using nvm and reinstall your modules.

The environment is configured to resemble our setup on Travis CI as much as
possible.
